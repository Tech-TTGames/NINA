> It's me, Antonina! Your reliable network security assistant! Nice to meet you! ... Oh, it's you, Professor.

A basic introduction to Antonina. (Not quite sure what exactly to write here yet, but probably more on the
story/personality side of the character.)

## Analysis
Let me be completely honest with you: Antonina is only worth raising if you really like her as a character, or if you enjoy torturing enemies with stunlocking. She is not exactly bad, but she is a defensive “jack of all trades, master of none” concept of a unit which doesn’t see much use in practice.

Antonina specializes at applying Stun to enemies by piling up Trojan stacks on them: they debuff the enemy Attack Speed, and upon accumulating too many of those the enemy gets Stunned for a fair amount of time. As a byproduct of her design, she also procs the powerful Flush algorithm set and Specialist functions really well, and she is solid at depleting blue bars on top. But this is where the good news end; even though Stun spam effectively reduces the amount of normal attacks and Autoskills the enemy can use on you, each part of Antonina’s kit can be covered with something else and with generally more useful Dolls:

- Attack Speed debuffing is usually a less effective method of defending against normal attacks than the Dodge / Blind strategies provided by Groove AI, Willow AI, Mai, or the semi-common Swift Crackdown function set.

- Stun is undeniably a good effect, but its Autoskill-stalling effect is done way more reliably by Angela or Mai. Hell, Banxsy AI3 can stall Autoskills with Dodge + Blind support just as well while actually doing a decent amount of damage in the process.

- Antonina’s blue bar breaking is quite potent and she can fit into Hashrate-scaling teams (most of the BB breakers scale from ATK), but some players can use either Puzzle, Souchun AI, or a strong ATK-scaling breaker like Lind or Centaureissi (despite the stat scaling conflict) instead of Antonina, all of which are either cheaper or more useful at something else than that.

- Antonina is not cheap. She relies on AI3, high rarity, and Taisch to be actually good and worth her cost.

However, Arma Inscripta 3 turns her into a rather unique and interesting unit which will be the focus of this guide because the rest of her kit is that uninteresting to talk about.
### Algorithms
/// tab | AI3 ATK build
Offensive: 12% ATK Deduction > Feedforward. The stat bonuses you gain from the algorithms are summed up with the Doll’s base stats and treated as a single inseparable number during the mission. For that reason, giving Antonina the Deduction set (Attack Speed +30) will make the multiplicative external Attack Speed buffs you get during the mission more effective on her. However, just +30 usually isn’t enough of a difference even in the best-case scenario, so you don’t miss out on much by running Feedforward instead.

Stability: 1800 HP “HP+2500”. Filler slot, roll for ATK and crit substats here.

Special: Crit Exploit = Flush = Delivery. Exploit should be used if you already have both Flush and Delivery somewhere else in your team, otherwise Antonina should be using whichever other option that your team is lacking: she procs both of those fairly well.
///

/// tab | Hashrate Support build
Offensive: 12% Hashrate “Hashrate +15%” > Deduction. It’s the other way round here: the Hashrate build relies on Autoskill and function proccing more do be impactful in any way, and Antonina’s lengthy Autoskill sequence + it getting spammed would make Attack Speed buffing barely worthwhile anyway.

Stability: 1800 HP “HP+2500”. Filler slot, roll for Hashrate substats.

Special: Skill Haste Exploit = Flush = Delivery. Same story as above, just with Skill Haste instead because this build can’t and shouldn’t crit (I am not convinced Hashrate Antonina is worth Daiyan-buffing due to her tiny 120% and 60% Autoskill multipliers).

### Teambuilding
/// tab | AI3 ATK build
Here Antonina is a DPS unit who might be lacking in damage, but her Stun spam and BB breaking will save your Dolls in some situations. Even if you go into Battlefield Overload, the ATK buff from it will benefit her anyway. Below is the list of Dolls who can support her:

Abigail - Antonina only really utilizes the crit buffing aspect of her kit, but it’s still a fine option if you have enough team slots or none of the better options. Low priority.

Groove AI or Willow AI2 - ATK Antonina deals damage through her normal attacks, so Attack Speed buffing is a given. We don’t really have any good options for non-environmental buffing, but those can do (Willow AI2 would require manual teleporting but the teams with Antonina are rarely battery-hungry anyway). Medium-high priority.

Mayuri - The strongest buffer for ATK Dolls in the game, use her if you have her. High priority.

Shield stacking - Dolls like Bonee, Kimie, Millau, and Turing can take advantage of Antonina stalling enemies to accumulate shields on your team much easier, which can save your backline from instant kills later or last for longer during Battlefield Overload. Niche priority.

Taisch - Her Ult generation and Ult CD shortening allow you to stunlock enemies via Antonina’s Ult (which would have the highest possible uptime against 2+ enemies). High priority.

Alternative Ultspam enablers - if you don’t have Taisch or you have to do some strict role compression, then Choco AI2, Daiyan AI3 or Helix can help you use Antonina’s oppressive Ult more often. Medium priority.

Rise - The “better than nothing” option if you don’t have anything else in this list. Low priority.
///

/// tab | Hashrate Support build
There is no dedicated team for optimizing Hashrate Antonina because that’s not how she works: she is a defensive support who can do some damage with the Malignant Interference set, and that’s it. Simply put her into the most replaceable slot in your team whenever you actually need her support.

If you seriously want to make the most out of her Stun spam, a Guard-less team with either a Warrior or a tanky Specialist is where Hashrate Antonina should go. Taisch is especially welcome here.
///
### Tips
/// tab | AI3 ATK build
 - Pay attention to who Antonina is targeting with her normal attacks (I know it’s hard with her attack animations but the big crit numbers should be an easy indication to follow) since those are her primary means of doing damage and being useful in general.
 - Autoskill pauses her normal attack sequence and results in a damage loss for the ATK build. Don’t spam the battery on Antonina with this build and utilize smart positioning + her Ultimate for suppressing the enemies.
///

/// tab | Hashrate Support build
 - The Malignant Interference and Efficiency Accumulation function sets make the Hashrate build more useful than the AI3 ATK one each in their own ways, and they effectively make Hashrate Antonina not a dead team slot: Malignant Interference pushes her own DPS above the AI3 ATK threshold and supports the actual Hashrate DPS buddy as well, meanwhile Efficiency Accumulation has great supportive and survivability-oriented cards that are useful for the entire team, and Antonina procs them really well. Those two sets also synergize with each other really well (especially in a Specialist-heavy team) so keep an eye on them.
 - Antonina is a fairly strong blue bar breaker, and her Stun spam really fucks over the enemies with long, channeling skills who are often protected by blue bars: Entropic Fortitude (purple porcupine who rolls like a ball) and Sinspreader EX (red flower) will be left helpless, while Odile and Odette have shield phases that can be bypassed if you use a crowd control effect on them in the meantime. While the latter two are bosses, they usually come with reasonably depletable blue bars. Ptolemaea is meant to be defeated with blue bar breakers, and Antonina qualifies as one.
 - The Ultimate is pretty straightforward: it just stuns the entire field twice for a relatively long time. The only two things I can add here:
    - There is a slight delay between Ult activation and the actual Stun happening (around 0.5 sec), keep that in mind.
    - Taisch allows you to spam her suppressing Ult more and achieve the maximum stunlocking potential.
