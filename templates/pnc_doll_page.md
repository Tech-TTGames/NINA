[Hello prospective guide creator! I'm here to assist you with creating your first doll article!]: #
[All around this template you'll see comments like this one! They're here to guide you on the usage of fields!]: #
[Before publishing the page, make sure you delete them!]: #
[Now a quick-start template notes:)]: #
[1! I have left multiple texts with < ... > around the template! Those are for you to replace with the correct data for the doll!]: #
[For example search and replace <Doll Name> with the name of the doll ie. "Antonina"]: #
[Make sure to upload the full set of images (icon, profile, passive, active, ultimate) to the folder /docs/assets/img/dolls/<Doll Name>]: #
[Then if you did everything correctly they'll be used in the correct places automatically! Suggested ratio for the profile is 3:2]: #
[Good luck and have fun writing about your favorite dolls!]: #
[(Make sure to look up to the "Meta" above those notes as well!)]: #

[A basic introduction to the character from the lore/personality PoV should be written here!]: #

## Analysis
[Insert a gameplay-wise analysis of the doll here!]: #

### Algorithms
[If you have muliple builds, whenever you see the // tab | <build name> option duplicate it with a different name!]: #
/// tab | <Standard/Meta build name>
[Algo set syntax: :algo-<set name>:&nbsp;<set name capitalized>, use <, >, or = for comparisons]: #
[Main stat syntax: :attr-<attr name shorthand check the overrides attr folder>:&nbsp;<Attribute name>, use <, > or / for comparisons]: #
[Notes: Any reasoning for the particular choices.]: #

| Slot      | Set | Main Stat | Note |
|-----------|-----|-----------|------|
| Offensive |     |           |      |
| Stability |     |           |      |
| Special   |     |           |      |
Add substat priority here, syntax same as main-stat.
///
   
### Teambuilding
/// tab | <Standard/Meta build name>
[Describe the role the doll plays in a team here]: #
[If needed to use the following template to display recommendations for teams with the doll, otherwise delete.]: #
[Doll: Just the name of the doll or if there's a lot of options description of the position. If it's a name of a doll use double brackets like this one -> ]: #
[Priority: How important that character is for this doll, High-Medium-Niche-Low, if necessary inbetween tiers ie. Medium-High.]: #
[Note: Note anything you consider important for that doll being in the team here, reasoning etc.]: #

| Doll | Priority | Note |
|------|----------|------|
|      |          |      |
